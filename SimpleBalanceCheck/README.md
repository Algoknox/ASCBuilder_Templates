# Simple Balance Check

This simple smart contract demonstrates a demo smart contract that takes a simple Application call, checks the caller for two conditions before approval:

1. Must be the creator address of the smart contract.
2. Must have a minimum of 1 $ALGO (1,000,000 micro Algos).

Otherwise, it rejects the call.

Import it into your app to take a look.
